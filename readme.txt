5. Is there anything special we need to know in order to run your code?
No, there's nothing special needed to run my code. However, I did include a bonus feature which dynamically updates the data in the same chart using Vega-Lite's data streaming API when you click the button. Instead of two charts, there is only one, which uses view.data('source_0', newData).run() to replace the data without re-rendering the entire chart.
